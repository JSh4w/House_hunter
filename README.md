Welcome to SiteToSheet, the primary README can be found here:
[SiteToSheet README](./SiteToSheet/README.md)

Brief: SiteToSheet was designed to assist web scraping capabilities with different tools. In the future, I want to add more functions to this package/ library which safely wraps different API's.
For now, it combines Natural Language Processing, Google Sheets API, Google Distance Matrix API, and Web Scraping capabilities for the user to do as they please.
